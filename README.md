Backend: [NodeJS](https://flatlogic.com/templates?backend%5B%5D=nodejs&sort=default)

    <details><summary>Backend Folder Structure</summary>   

    The generated application has the following backend folder structure: 

    `src` folder which contains your working files that will be used later to create the build. The src folder contains folders as:

      - `auth` - config the library for authentication and authorization;

      - `db` - contains such folders as:

        - `api` - documentation that is automatically generated by jsdoc or other tools;

        - `migrations` - is a skeleton of the database or all the actions that users do with the database;

        - `models`- what will represent the database for the backend;

        - `seeders` -  the entity that creates the data for the database.

      - `routes` - this folder would contain all the routes that you have created using Express Router and what they do would be exported from a Controller file;

      - `services` - contains such folders as `emails` and `notifications`.

Database: PostgreSQL

  -----------------------

We offer 2 ways how to start the project locally: by running Frontend and Backend or with Docker

 To start the project:

 Backend:

> Please change current folder: `cd backend`

Install local dependencies:
`yarn install`

Adjust local db:
  Install postgres:

MacOS:

`brew install postgres`

    > if you don’t have ‘brew‘ please install it (https://brew.sh) and repeat step `brew install postgres`.

Ubuntu:

`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib`

  Create db and admin user:
Before run and test connection, make sure you have created a database as described in the above configuration. You can use the `psql` command to create a user and database.

`psql postgres --u postgres`

Next, type this command for creating a new user with password then give access for creating the database.

`postgres-# CREATE ROLE admin WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'admin_pass';`

`postgres-# ALTER ROLE admin CREATEDB;`

Quit `psql` then log in again using the new user that previously created.

`postgres-# \q`

`psql postgres -U admin`

Type this command to creating a new database.

`postgres=> CREATE DATABASE db_{your_project_name};`

Then give that new user privileges to the new database then quit the `psql`.

`postgres=> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE db_{your_project_name} TO admin;`

`postgres=> \q`

 Create database:
`yarn db:create`

 Start production build:
`yarn start`
